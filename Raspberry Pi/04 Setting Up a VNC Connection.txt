from the command line interface on your Pi, install tightvnc server

  sudo apt-get install tightvncserver -y
  
after the installation is complete, type the following

  vncserver
  
You will be prompted for a password that you will use to log in via vnc from a remote client.

The server should now be running on your Pi; it's listening on port 5901

On the client (remote) side, you will need a VNC client-program in order to interface with your Pi.  One of the easiest solutions is to install the VNC client extention for Chrome

Chrome 
--> drop-down (three vertical dots near the upper right corner of the window
  --> More Tools
    --> Extensions
      --> More Extensions (scroll ALL THE WAY DOWN)
        --> You're now in the store.  Search for VNC.  I chose VNC Viewer for Google Chrome, but you have options
        
Open the Extension.  It'll show up under "apps" in the chrome toolbar, which for some reason only appears in a brand new tab for me... *shrugs*
Log in to your Pi, using <StaticIp>:5901 as the address (e.g. 192.168.0.4:5901, if your ip was 192.168.0.4), and the password that you stipulated while setting up the server.

To make it so that the VNC server automatically starts when the Pi boots up, perform the following actions:

Create the following script, and save it as /etc/init.d/tightvncserver

  #!/bin/sh
  # /etc/init.d/tightvncserver

  VNCUSER='pi'
  case "$1" in
     start)
        su $VNCUSER -c '/usr/bin/tightvncserver :1'
        echo "Starting TightVNC Server for $VNCUSER "
        ;;
     stop)
        pkill Xtightvnc
        echo "TightVNC Server stopped"
        ;;
     *)
        echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/tightvncserver {start|stop}"
        exit 1
        ;;
  esac
  exit 0

change the files permissions so that it is executable

  sudo chmod a+x "/etc/init.d/tightvncserver"
  sudo update-rc.d tightvncserver defaults
  
If you ever want to stop this service from running on boot, type the following

  sudo update-rc.d tightvncserver remove
