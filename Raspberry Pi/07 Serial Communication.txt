That's a fairly simple walk-through that uses python to send data out on the GPIO and read it in from one of the USB ports.  If you don't have the RS-232 connector/adapter (I didn't), you can jury-rig a cable from a standard USB cable fairly easily.  The GPIO pins 4, 6, 8, and 10 are the pin numbers (physical) that we are using, with the power provided by 4 (5V) and 6 (GND), and the logic being transferred on 8 (TxD) and 10 (RxD).  

8 and 10 are the "UART" pins

The color of the wires should indicate which wires go where.  (Check out almost any of the USB wiring images that you can find online)

Some notes:
I didn't find that disabling the serial port was necessary

My serial connection was on ttyS0, not ttyAMA0.  This may be why I didn't need to disable the serial port...
