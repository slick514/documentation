import required libraries
	from tkinter import *
	from tkinter import ttk

creating a base/'root' window
	root = Tk()

creating a button
	button = ttk.Button(root, text = 'Whatever...')

actually displaying the button
	button.pack()

simulate a button click via command:
	button.invoke[]

creating/using a callback:
	def cb():
		print('clicked')
	button.config(command = cb)
	
disabling (greying out) components:
	button.state(['disabled'])

Create the reference to the image as a part of the parent object.  This will preclude the possibility of garbage collection when things move out of scope
	button.img = PhotoImage(file = '<file path>')
	button.config(image = button.img)

add the image to the button...
setting "compound = LEFT" overlays the text on top of the image, with the image to the left...
	button.config(image = logo, compound = LEFT)
	
Make your image smaller, to fit!
"logo_reference.subsample(x, y)" will take every "x"th pixel on the x axis, and every "y"th pixel on the y axis....
	small_logo = logo.subsample()
