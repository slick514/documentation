# valid percent substitutions (from the Tk entry man page)
# note: you only have to register the ones you need;
# In this example, we are only registering '%P'
#
# %d = Type of action (1=insert, 0=delete, -1 for others)
# %i = index of char string to be inserted/deleted, or -1
# %P = value of the entry if the edit is allowed
# %s = value of entry prior to editing
# %S = the text string being inserted or deleted, if any
# %v = the type of validation that is currently set
# %V = the type of validation that triggered the callback
#      (key, focusin, focusout, forced)
# %W = the tk name of the widget


example code:

...
	def populate_configuration_dialogue(self, root):
		text = StringVar()
		text.set(self.too_few_threshold)
		self._threshold_entry = ttk.Entry(root, textvariable=text, validate="key")
		self._threshold_entry['validatecommand'] = (self._threshold_entry.register(enforce_numeric), '%P')
		self._threshold_entry.pack()
		self._threshold_entry.textVar = text # make sure the reference isn't deallocated
...

def enforce_numeric(proposed_value):
	try:
		float(proposed_value)
		valid = True
	except ValueError:
		valid = proposed_value in ('.', '')
	return valid
