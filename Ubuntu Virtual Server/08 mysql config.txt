# primary mysql configuration file is in /etc/mysql/my.cnf
# This in turn reads in configuration information from any ".cnf" files in the directories "/etc/mysql/conf.d/" and "/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/"
# /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf has most of the configuration information that we want to look at...
# Add the following lines after "skip-external-locking"
#	collation-server = utf8_unicode_ci
#	character-set-server = utf8

# By default, mysql only listens to localhost connections.  To change this so that we can connect from the host OS, change the bind-address as shown.  This allows connection from any address:
# 	bind-address = 0.0.0.0

# Add support for slow query logging:
# 	slow_query_log 	= 1
#	slow_query_log_file = /var/log/mysql/mysql-slow.log
#	...
#	long_query_time	= 2

# Any instances of "key_buffer" should be changed to "key_buffer_size"

# Restart mysql for changes to take effect
sudo service mysql restart

# NEVER DO THIS ON PRODUCTION!
# Change mysql root permissions to allow connection from anywhere
# Login to mysql
mysql -uroot -p

# From mysql prompt
UPDATE mysql.user SET host='%' WHERE user='root' AND host='sandbox';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit;

# Log in using MySql Workbench (or similar)
# * Add a connection
# * Fill in the following:
# 	* hostname (sandbox.ubuntu.dev)
# 	* port (forwarded port = 9306)
#	* click "Store in Keychain" to add root password to keychain and avoid prompt
#	* Test Connection to verify things, and check out "server status"...
