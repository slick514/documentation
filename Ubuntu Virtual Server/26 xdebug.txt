# Xdebug is a PHP extension for debugging and profiling; it should be used only in development environments
# PHP's native debugging is somewhat limited, and Xdebug can provide context/info for fatal errors that would otherwise be inaccessible.  Xdebug can also profile code down to the line, which can help ID bottlenecks
sudo apt-get -y install php5-xdebug
...
sudo service apache2 restart

# Navigate to the errors page:  http://sandbox.ubuntu.dev:8083/errors.php
# Errors now have additional information, including a stacktrace(!)  Yay!!!

# Xdebug costs time/resources, so turn it off if you aren't using it
sudo php5dismod xdebug
sudo service apache2 restart

# Use "usdo php5enmod xdebug" to re-enable;  must restart apache after

# Use xdebug to profile:  This is not enabled by default
# Enable the trigger for profiling
sudoedit /etc/php5/mods-available/xdebug.ini

# Add the following two lines
#	xdebug.profiler_enable_trigger = 1
#	xdebug.profiler_output_dir = /tmp/cachegrind

# Add the profiler output directory and restart Apache
mkdir /tmp/cachegrind
sudo chown www-data: /tmp/cachegrind
sudo service apache2 restart
