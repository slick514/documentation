# CakePHP is an application framework

# Download/install using composer
cd /media/sf_sandbox
composer create-project --prefer-dist cakephp/app cakephp

# cakePHP does not presently (v.3) support table-prefixes, so use phpmyadmin to create a new mysql User and corresponding database:
# user: 		cakephp
# password: 	cakephp

# Alter /cakephp/config/app.php
# 	* Add lines to the Datasources->default, and Datasources->test arrays that correspond to the database created

# Alter /cakephp/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Utility/Security.php
# 	* Add/Change the security salt
#		protected static $_salt = 'somelongalphanumericstring';

# Alter /cakephp/vendor/cakephp/cakephp/src/Core/Configure.php
# 	* enable debugging by changing debug to true:
#		'debug' => true

# DebugKit uses SQLite and stores debugging info in a db located in the app's /tmp directory
sudo apt-get install -y sqlite
... output + wait ...

# Enable DebugKit
bin/cake plugin load DebugKit
